                    <h3> <b> Definition of IoT </b></h3>
                    <p>The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.</p>
                    <p>A thing on the internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address and is able to transfer data over a network.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How does IoT apply on Agriculture?</h3>
                    <p>IoT devices may be of assistance to farmers in different ways. To allow farmers to obtain an abundance of informative data such as the temperature of stored goods, the amount of fertilizer used, the number of seeds planted, the storage conditions, the status of farm equipment and machinery, sensors can be installed across farms and farm machines. </p>
                    
                    <p>When an IoT- program is in place, farmers can easily monitor and make informed decisions on a variety of environmental variables. More than just an improvement, IoT farming is a necessary advancement that could help farmers cope with all the challenges they face in farming if properly implemented. The rich insights obtained from smart sensors could also enable farmers to be more effective in using pesticides and fertilizers, thereby mitigating environmental impacts. IoT device monitoring of plant and soil conditions is a simple case of use which can result in a fantastic return on investment for farmers using sensing technology.</p>

                    <p>Several technologies that are behind these IoT platforms are drones, LED lamps, energy storage, transmitters, microcontrollers, etc.</p>
                    
                <h3><b>How can one use IoT on Agriculture</b></h3>
                <p>The IoT can be used in a variety of ways. For example, you can add sensors to your farm equipment or wearable devices to your cattle. After you install them, the sensors will allow you to harvest data from your operations so that you can instantly see where your cattle are located. If you put sensors on your machines, you can prevent breakdowns and unexpected costs because you can tell when maintenance work must be done.</p>
                 
                <h3><b>Impact of IoT on Agriculture</b></h3>
                <p>The IoT refers to devices that exchange information over the internet and can operate on each other. IoT in agriculture is a subset of IoT space that focuses on crop and livestock data generation, health assessment, related issues more effectively than a human input. In agriculture, the main function of IoT is to incorporate a control, decision-making, and action circle into agriculture. First, measurements on a crop condition are taken by attached sensors. The large amounts of data are condensed into a format that the farmers can easily understand. The obvious outcome is greater performance. Farmers can make educated decisions about appropriate crop treatments by always having relevant data at their disposal. They can forecast yields, and schedule related costs of labour. This is called precision agriculture.</p>
                
                <p>IoT is closely related to automation, so it needs less human interaction and fewer workers. The resulting crop yield rises and reductions in overhead and operating costs make agriculture more competitive. Also, this can benefit from IoT adoption not just for large-scale farming activities, but small family farms, organic farms or even rooftop gardens.</p>

                            Advantages of IoT in agriculture

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Water treatment can be carried out effectively using the IoT system without the use of sensors for wasting water.
                                </li>
                                <li>The IoT device helps to track the land constantly so that steps can be taken early. It increases efficiency, decreases manual labour, decreases time, and allows productive farming.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The monitoring of the crop can be done easily by using IoT to track crop production.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Soil control such as pH level and humidity content etc. can be easily identified so farmers can sow seeds according to the soil level.

                            <ul>
                                <li>IoT – smart farming continually requires internet connectivity. The developing countries ‘rural portion did not follow those criteria and the internet is slower.
                               </li>

                               <li>
                                Given any security measures, the system offers little power and can lead to various kinds of network attacks.
                               </li>
                               <li>
                                It is very complicated to plan, build, manage and allow the broad technology to IoT framework.
