                <p>This work presented a systematic review of the state-of-the-art of IoT adoption in smart agriculture and identified the main components and applicability of IoT solutions. This review reported a change in the treatment of data in recent works: while previous work showed that the majority of decision support systems used simple processing mechanisms to handle data collected in real-time, more recent work showed an increasing number of management systems that use complementary technologies that rely on cloud and big data computing for processing large amounts of data. Furthermore, it was observed in this review that in recent work the use of artificial intelligence and image processing techniques has become more common to improve the management of smart farming. From the identified applications of IoT for smart farming it was observed that the most common application is the monitoring of crops. This review also showed that different network protocols may be simultaneously used in IoT solutions for smart farming. In addition, the comparison of types of network connections used in IoT solutions for smart farming revealed that wired networks are used in indoor scenarios (e.g., greenhouse) while wireless networks are used both in indoor and outdoor scenarios (e.g., arable lands, orchards). Moreover, the review discussed in this work suggests the increasing relevance of IoT solutions for smart farming. Future work may extend this review by including other relevant articles and complementary analysis of project costs, usability and regional challenges intrinsic to IoT applications. Another important future research direction could be the analysis of the edge and fog computing usage in smart agriculture as a way to deal with challenges associated with traditional centralized cloud solutions such as high communication latencies, lack of support for real-time reaction to detected events, large bandwidths, etc.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">1</a></sup></p>
