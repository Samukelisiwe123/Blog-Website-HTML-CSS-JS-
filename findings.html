                <p>After conducting the research, I found out that a lot of people are quite informed about the IoT especially males, which makes it easier for them to know about the use of IoT on agriculture. It made my investigation less challenging as I saw that many of my participants have knowledge which gives me the idea that a lot outside the world are informed, and they know a lot when it comes to IoT even though I could not reach a lot of the people but the those who managed to answer gave me the answers that I needed for my survey.</p>

                    <p>The Graphs above are the summary of the respondents and what I have gathered after asking different people from different age groups if they are informed or know about IoT and IoT on agriculture</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Graph 1 : </b>age</li>
                        <p>The graph simply shows that that people or age group that is mostly informed about the Smart farming are the People of ages between 19-35 years with 57.1% and the least knowledgeable group is the group from 12-18 years with 28.6%.
                        </p>
                        <li><b>Graph 2 : </b>Province</li>
                        <p>In this graph we can clearly see that I have made my investigation from different provinces, and it shows that many people who are informed or know about the IoT are from Gauteng which shows that it is the most developed province when it comes to technology and the use of internet.  
                        </p>
                        <li><b>Graph 3 and 4 : </b>Devices owned and how of do they use the internet</li>
                        <p>The device that almost all my participants are using is the smartphone which shows that even though they know more about IoT they donâ€™t use many of the devices and the other graph shows that they use the internet daily which means they can do the research easily if they want to know more about the IoT and Smart Farming.
